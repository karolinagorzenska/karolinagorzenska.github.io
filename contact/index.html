			I am a dreamer and a maker. I recognize the inherent value of all life and in order for all to thrive, I engage in empowered, responsible action. I have an intention of showing intimacy in relation to the natual world. I dream of living in a net of reciprocity between human beings and the rest of the biosphere.
I am searching for new ways to become entangled with the nonhuman world. I combine the naive romanticism with the pragmatic need for radically new narratives for the changing world. One of my main questions that drive my artistic practice is whether enlightment is possible in the age of Antropocene. With my art I wish to dissolve boundaries between the self and the other as well as the boundaries between different species. I believe that human beings have a tremendous spiritual potential that is yet unrealized and I vow to seek its realization. I'm casting small benevolent spells, seeds for a thriving future. My research is simultaneously my practice. I strive to create visual art that will be my love song to the world.
  
			I am a Gdynia-based Polish artist born in 1997, recently graduated from Minerva Art Academy in Groningen, the Netherlands. In my art practice, I make use of different media based on my current needs or what I want to express. The main media I use are traditional photography and drawing, combined with painting, collaging,  filmmaking, bookbinding and various crafts. I research intimacy in relation to the world. I use my creative drive to gather insights about myself, my inner world, but also the outer world, through my relationship with it. It is my belief we build our reality ourselves by dreaming it up, and this is my mission as an artist to share my dreams and help create a better reality.
